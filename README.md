# Learn It (ðŸš§ Work-In-Progress ðŸš§)
Master your memory using spaced repetition!

## Concept
Welcome to "Learn It" App. Master complex topics using spaced repetition. You cannot take your sweet time to understand a topic. The world won't wait for you. The only way to keep up in such scenarios is to memorise the content. Your brain will constantly try to find patterns and make sense of what you remembered. After several revisions you will eventually understand it. This App will help you revise efficiently using spaced repetition technique which is scientifically tested.

As Jon Von Neumann says, "In mathematics, you don't understand things, you just get used to them." Some people think this is a wrong statement but this is a fact. Humans don't see recursion and iteration in their daily lives. These kind of topics will only make sense when you get used to them.
